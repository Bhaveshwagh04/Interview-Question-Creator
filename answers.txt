\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: \nAnswer: The text doesn't mention how many mega-cities existed in the year 2000, it only mentions that in 1990 there were 10 and by 2014 the number had grown to 28. 
\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: **Data Extraction and Representation:**\nAnswer: Please provide me with the data you would like to have extracted and represented. I need more context to understand your request. For example:

* **What data are we looking at?** Is it text, a table, a website, or something else? 
* **What information are we trying to extract?** Are there specific keywords, numbers, or patterns we are looking for? 
* **How should the extracted data be represented?** Should it be in a table, a chart, a summary, or another format?

Once you provide me with more information, I can help you extract and represent the data effectively. 
\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: \nAnswer: I'm sorry, but the text you provided doesn't contain the answer to your question. It focuses on explaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and how the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is working towards achieving them. 

Please provide your question, and I'll do my best to answer it using the context you've given or any other information I can access. 
\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: 1.  **Goal Identification:** Write a function that analyzes the text and extracts all 17 Sustainable Development Goals.  How would you store these goals and their descriptions in a data structure suitable for your chosen programming language (e.g., list, dictionary, array)?\nAnswer: \n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: 2.  **Target Parsing:** Several goals mention specific targets (e.g., "reduce per capita food waste in half globally"). Design a function to identify and extract these quantifiable targets from the text. How would you represent these targets in your data structure, linking them to their respective goals?\nAnswer: ```python
import re

def extract_targets(text):
  """
  Identifies and extracts quantifiable targets from text.

  Args:
    text: The text to parse for targets.

  Returns:
    A dictionary where keys are goals and values are lists of extracted targets 
    associated with that goal.
  """

  targets_by_goal = {}
  current_goal = None

  # Split the text into lines for easier processing
  for line in text.split('\n'):
    # Use a regex to look for patterns like "reduce [something] by [number]" 
    # or "limit [something] to [number]"
    match = re.search(r'(reduce|limit|increase|cut)\s+(.+?)\s+(by|to)\s+(.+?)\b', line, re.IGNORECASE)
    if match:
      action = match.group(1)
      target_object = match.group(2).strip()
      preposition = match.group(3)
      target_value = match.group(4).strip()

      target_phrase = f"{action} {target_object} {preposition} {target_value}"
      
      if current_goal:
        targets_by_goal.setdefault(current_goal, []).append(target_phrase)

    # Update the current goal if a new section header is detected
    elif line.isupper():
      current_goal = line.strip() 

  return targets_by_goal

# Example usage:
text = """
... (Your provided text) ...
"""
targets = extract_targets(text)
print(targets)
```

**Data Structure:**

The code returns a dictionary:

* **Keys:** Sustainable Development Goal titles (strings).
* **Values:** Lists of strings, where each string represents a quantifiable target extracted from the text related to that goal.

**Example Output:**

```
{
  'ENSURE SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION PATTERNS': 
    ['cut per capita food waste in half globally'], 
  'TAKE URGENT ACTION TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACTS': 
    ['limit the increase in global mean temperature to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels']
  // ... other goals and their targets
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Regular Expression:** The core of the function is a regular expression (`re.search`) that looks for specific patterns indicating a quantifiable target. It identifies phrases containing verbs like "reduce," "limit," "increase," or "cut," followed by the object of the target and the target value.

2. **Goal Association:** The code iterates through the text line by line. If a line is in all uppercase, it's considered a new goal section header. The extracted targets are then associated with the current goal.

3. **Data Storage:** The `targets_by_goal` dictionary stores the extracted information, making it easy to access targets based on their corresponding Sustainable Development Goal. 
\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: 3.  **Progress Tracking:**  Devise a system for representing progress towards each goal. This could involve:\nAnswer: I can't answer that question. The provided text outlines the Sustainable Development Goals but does not specify a system for representing progress towards each goal. 
\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion:     *   **Numerical Data:**  Storing relevant statistics (e.g., percentage of people living in extreme poverty, access to electricity). Where would you source this data (e.g., APIs, CSV files)?\nAnswer: This question asks for ideal sources of numerical data on global development. Here are some of the best options:

// Using Leaflet

// 1. Fetch and prepare data (example using a CSV file)
fetch('sdg_data.csv')
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(data => {
    const processedData = processData(data); // Function to parse CSV and structure data

    // 2. Create Leaflet map
    const map = L.map('map').setView([20, 0], 3); // Centered on the world
    L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png').addTo(map);

    // 3. Create choropleth layer (assuming GeoJSON format for country boundaries)
    const geoJsonLayer = L.choropleth(processedData, {
      valueProperty: 'indicatorValue', // Data property to use for coloring
      scale: ['yellow', 'red'], // Color scale
      steps: 5, // Number of color steps
      onEachFeature: (feature, layer) => {
        layer.bindPopup(`Country: ${feature.properties.name}<br>Value: ${feature.properties.indicatorValue}`);
      }
    }).addTo(map);

    // 4. Add legend
    const legend = L.control({ position: 'bottomright' });
    legend.onAdd = () => {
      // ... create legend content based on the color scale
    };
    legend.addTo(map);
  }); 
```

**Additional Considerations:**

\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: 7.  **Data Storytelling:** How would you use data visualization and interactive elements to tell compelling stories about the SDGs and inspire users to take action?\nAnswer: While I can't create actual visualizations, I can give you a breakdown of how to use data visualization and interactive elements to tell compelling stories about the SDGs and inspire action:

**1. Choose the Right Data:**

* **Focus on relatable metrics:** Instead of abstract figures, translate data into tangible impacts. For example, instead of "reduce child mortality," show how many children's lives are saved per year with increased access to vaccines.
* **Highlight local impact:**  Allow users to filter data by country or region to see how the SDGs relate to their own lives and communities.
* **Track progress over time:**  Use timelines, bar charts, or line graphs to show how far we've come and how much work is left to do. This can create a sense of urgency and momentum.

**2. Craft a Narrative:**

* **Don't just present data, tell a story:**  Frame your visualizations with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Introduce the challenge, show the progress (or lack thereof), and highlight the potential for positive change.
* **Use human-centered design:** Put people at the heart of your story. Share personal anecdotes, case studies, or videos that connect emotionally with the audience.
* **Focus on solutions:**  While it's important to acknowledge the problems, emphasize the positive impact of taking action. Show how even small contributions can make a difference.

**3. Make it Interactive and Engaging:**

* **Use interactive maps:**  Allow users to explore data geographically. For example, a map could show regions with the highest poverty rates or the impact of climate change on different parts of the world.
* **Create quizzes and polls:**  Engage users with interactive elements that test their knowledge and encourage them to learn more about the SDGs.
* **Incorporate data visualization tools:** Utilize platforms like Tableau, Google Data Studio, or Flourish to create dynamic and shareable visualizations.

**4. Call to Action:**

* **Make it easy to get involved:**  Provide clear and concise calls to action throughout the experience. 
* **Offer a variety of ways to participate:**  Suggest concrete actions users can take, such as donating to a relevant organization, signing a petition, volunteering their time, or changing their consumption habits.
* **Track and celebrate impact:**  If possible, show users how their actions are contributing to the SDGs. This can create a sense of ownership and encourage continued engagement.

**Example:**

Imagine an interactive website dedicated to SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). Users could:

* **Explore a world map:**  See regions facing water scarcity and learn about the challenges they face.
* **Click on individual communities:**  Read stories about people impacted by lack of clean water and sanitation.
* **Discover solutions:** Learn about organizations working to provide clean water and sanitation, and see the impact of their work through data visualizations.
* **Take action:** Donate to a chosen organization, sign a petition advocating for water rights, or learn about ways to conserve water in their own lives.

By combining compelling data visualization with interactive elements and a strong narrative, you can create powerful experiences that inspire users to learn about the SDGs and take action towards a more sustainable future.
